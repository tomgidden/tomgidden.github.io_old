## Introduction

I know this site is weak.  Sorry about that.  I had a Wordpress-based site that I rarely updated, containing
a lot of material that was rapidly becoming out-of-date.  I was tempted to take the interesting stuff and
paste it here, but after reviewing I realised none of it was really relevant anymore.

So, a clean start.

On the other hand, I've got a lot of other things to do, so I haven't spent any effort doing this placeholder
site either.  Please don't take the paucity of this site as a sign of what I'm capable of: I've done some very
nice websites before, but it's part of my day job so doing some more of it for a site no-one's going to look at
(except you) isn't exactly my highest priority.

## About me

I'm a geek living in the UK, working at [Starberry](https://starberry.tv/) as their Head Geek: a multi-role capacity,
from strategic to technical, getting my hands dirty with development, architecture,
documentation, training, operations, and just about a bit of everything really; working with a large team
of talented developers and telling them they're doing it wrong, ie. not the way I'd do it.

In my spare time, I geek out on various tech projects when I have the time, on a wide range of bits and pieces.
I also watch a lot of movies.

Please don't bother contacting me if you want to recruit me or add me to a database of people you want to get
other people to recruit: I'm happy where I'm working.

## More

* [GitHub](https://github.com/tomgidden)... although nothing much there at the moment, to be honest.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomgidden)... although I don't post much there anymore.
* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/tom.gidden)... although I keep my friends list to people I know in real life.
* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/tomgidden)... although I usually ignore stuff on there, as it's almost always recruiters.
* [Flickr](http://flickr.com/_gid)... although I stopped posting photos there when I stopped carrying a camera with me.

So yeah. I'm a ruddy social butterfly, me.  One of these days I might actually pad one of those out a bit. Don't hold your breath, though.

In the meantime, here's a picture I drew.
