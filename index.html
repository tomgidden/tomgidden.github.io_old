## Introduction

I know this site is weak.  Sorry about that.  I had a Wordpress-based site that I rarely updated, containing
a lot of material that was rapidly becoming out-of-date.  I was tempted to take the interesting stuff and
paste it here, but after reviewing I realised none of it was really relevant anymore.

So, a clean start.

On the other hand, I've got a lot of other things to do, so I haven't spent any effort doing this placeholder
site either.  Please don't take the paucity of this site as a sign of what I'm capable of: I've done some very
nice websites before, but it's part of my day job so doing some more of it for a site no-one's going to look at
(except you) isn't exactly my highest priority.

## About me

I'm a geek living in the UK, working at <a href="https://starberry.tv/" target="_blank">Starberry</a>,
in a multi-role capacity, from strategic to technical, getting my hands dirty with development, architecture,
documentation, training, operations, and just about a bit of everything really.

In my spare time, I geek out on various tech projects when I have the time, on a wide range of bits and pieces.
I also watch a lot of movies.
